However, the relationship between zinc status and post-acute COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between ZD and long-term outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methodology We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database, including patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2022, and July 31, 2023. Patients had documented serum or plasma zinc levels within three months before COVID-19 diagnosis and were not deceased or hospitalized in the first month of infection. They were categorized into ZD (zinc levels &lt;70&#x202f;&#x3bc;g/dL) and control (zinc levels &#x2265;70&#x202f;&#x3bc;g/dL) groups. After 1:1 propensity score matching for demographic and clinical variables, outcomes were assessed from 30 to 180 days post-diagnosis, including all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and four subphenotypes of post-acute COVID-19. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results After matching, each group included 1,863 patients with balanced baseline characteristics. The ZD group had a higher incidence of all-cause hospitalization (25.3% vs. 20.3%; HR = 1.314; 95% CI = 1.148-1.505; p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001) and all-cause mortality (3.8% vs. 2.2%; HR = 1.735; 95% CI = 1.180-2.551; p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.045) compared to the control group during the follow-up period. Among the four subphenotypes, only the cardiac and renal subphenotype showed a significantly higher risk in the ZD group (HR = 1.099; 95% CI = 1.002-1.205; p = 0.004). Conclusions ZD is associated with increased risks of long-term hospitalization, mortality, and increased risk in COVID-19 patients with cardiac and renal comorbidities. Monitoring and managing zinc levels may be important for improving long-term outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore the potential benefits of zinc supplementation in COVID-19 patients with ZD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Hung et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hung</LastName><ForeName>Lun-Wu</ForeName><Initials>LW</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Liu</LastName><ForeName>Mei-Yuan</ForeName><Initials>MY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Nutrition, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Yu</LastName><ForeName>Tsung</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hung</LastName><ForeName>Kuo-Chuan</ForeName><Initials>KC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Anaesthesiology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tsai</LastName><ForeName>Ya-Wen</ForeName><Initials>YW</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Division of Preventive Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lai</LastName><ForeName>Chih-Cheng</ForeName><Initials>CC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wu</LastName><ForeName>Jheng-Yan</ForeName><Initials>JY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Nutrition, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, TWN.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>10</Month><Day>16</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Cureus</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101596737</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2168-8184</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">long covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">mortality</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">post-acute covid-19</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">zinc deficiency</Keyword></KeywordList><CoiStatement>Human subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
