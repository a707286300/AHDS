While various risk factors are known, the link between workplace factors and Long COVID is underexplored. We conducted a cohort study to examine the impact of pre-infection workplace stressors on Long COVID among Japanese workers, with the aim of improving understanding of its disease process and inform workplace management.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This prospective cohort study used online survey data collected in December 2020 and December 2022 from 1,539 participants with no initial infection history but later reported COVID-19. Workplace stressors were assessed at baseline using the Job Content Questionnaire, which measured job demands, job control, and social support. At the follow-up survey, COVID-19 infection was determined by self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 test by PCR or antigen, and development of Long COVID was defined as symptoms persisting for over two months. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses estimated odds ratios for the association between workplace stressors and the development of Long COVID.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Of the participants, 248 reported Long COVID. Univariate analysis showed that both high job demands (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.09-2.20) and poor job control (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.04-2.18) increased the odds. Poor supervisor support (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.16-2.58) and co-worker support (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.13-2.23) were also significant. On multivariate analysis, job demands remained significantly associated with Long COVID.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our findings indicate that pre-infection workplace stressors may contribute to Long-COVID development in workers. Managing workplace stressors effectively could be a preventive measure.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#xa9; The Author(s) [2024].
